 ### Step 5: 

Weâ€™ll create a command that allows Nagios to use the NRPE command we just set up. Navigate to the following location:

 	cd /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/

Next, open the commands.cfg file using the vim editor or nano:

    vim commands.cfg
    nano commands.cfg

Scroll to the end of the file and add the following command definition:

    define command{
      command_name check_nrpe
      command_line $USER1$/check_nrpe -H $HOSTADDRESS$ -c $ARG1$
    }
  

### Step 6: Check instalation

    /usr/local/nagios/libexec/check_nrpe -H <IP_del_servidor_NRPE> -c <nombre_del_comando>

Usage
=================

Installing NRPE (Nagios Remote Plugin Executor) is crucial for expanding the monitoring capabilities of Nagios. NRPE allows Nagios to remotely execute plugins on Linux/Unix machines and retrieve their results. This enables monitoring of local resources, services, and performance metrics that are not accessible directly from the Nagios server. By deploying NRPE, administrators can monitor critical aspects of their infrastructure, such as CPU usage, memory utilization, disk space, and specific application metrics, with greater granularity and accuracy. NRPE facilitates proactive monitoring and timely detection of issues, leading to faster troubleshooting and resolution. Additionally, NRPE enhances security by restricting access to sensitive system resources and ensuring that monitoring tasks are executed with appropriate permissions. Overall, integrating NRPE into the Nagios monitoring environment enhances its effectiveness and provides deeper insights into the health and performance of the entire infrastructure.
